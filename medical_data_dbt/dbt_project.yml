models:
  medical_data_dbt:
    # This config applies to ALL models within your 'medical_data_dbt' project
    # By default, materialize all models as views. You can override this
    # for specific models or subdirectories.
    +materialized: view

    # You can also configure specific subdirectories if you want different materializations
    # For example, to make staging models views and marts tables:
    # staging:
    #   +materialized: view
    # marts:
    #   +materialized: table # Often fact/dimension tables are materialized as tables
